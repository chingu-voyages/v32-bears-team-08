## Motivation

> We believe that learning a new skill, practicing a hobby, or delving into deep learning on a topic is better together.

## Description

> Learn together connects self-learners and autodidacts who share similar interests. After creating their profile, users receive a curated list of recommended learning partners whom they can contact using the in-app email feature.
